Let's use the hottest and greatest technologies. Let's solve a simple problem in the most complex way. Let's add more and more layers to our architecture. Let's call all code which is 3 months or older, legacy. Got domain specific problems? No problem, just throw new tech at it!

Overengineering is an increasing problem in software development that needs to be tackled at some point. As always, things are easier said than done. This talk looks at the human challenges we as developers face, the reasons behind overengineering and how we should avoid it.
