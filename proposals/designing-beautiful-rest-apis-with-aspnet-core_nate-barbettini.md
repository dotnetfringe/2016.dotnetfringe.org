Description
-----------

Core 1.0 is the latest iteration of ASP.NET. Whatâ€™s changed? Everything! This new paradigm represents the future of the framework and the .NET ecosystem.

I'll do a deep dive into how to build RESTful APIs the right way on top of ASP.NET Core 1.0 Web API. Come learn from my mistakes on things like:

* Thinking about REST APIs the right way
* What the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT) mean
* How to do automated testing
* Representing relationships
* Designing collections and paging

Speaker Bio

I'm the .NET Developer Evangelist at Stormpath in San Francisco, which means I'm "the dot net guy" in an office full of Java and Node engineers. :smile:

Prior to Stormpath, I was a full-stack developer working in C# and Angular, and ran a video production company producing short films and music videos. On the weekend you'll find me contributing to a number of open-source projects, editing short films, and training for a marathon.
