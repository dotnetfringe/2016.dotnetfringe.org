With a new Javascript framework available every year, the development commuinity has been indoctrinated to adopt the best technology available at the time. This means that countless lines of code of varying quality, closed source and open source, gets taken on by organizations. The "Total Cost of Ownership of Code" has sky rocketed. Everyone cheers developers on as their 10 line solution is made possible by including a 100K LoC library. The greater threat is the implied interdependencies, diamond dependency patters and other problems that arise as this approach continues.
In this talk, the technology choices are looked at in terms of the real costs of the "Buy vs Build" mantra. Due to tooling proliferation, 3 seldom analyzed areas will be focused on:
 
 - Build your own CI/CD system 
 - Bulid your own Kanban board for agility
 - Build your own Behaviour Driven Design convention for automated specifications
 
The exploration of these 3 areas with a 0-tech approach will give a grounding in what the actual value tooling brings to an organization. Bringing the focus on the need without the distraction of what tooling brings along with it, more organizations can wake up from the daze of sinking 3 days of development time into configuring Jenkins correctly.
