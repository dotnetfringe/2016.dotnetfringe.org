Description

VS Code is new text editor (or rather lightweight IDE) created by Microsoft. Because it is product based on Electron - cross platform engine allowing developers to write desktop applications using web technologies - its plugin system supports JavaScript (and TypeScript). Unfortunately both those languages are not nice choice for someone using statically typed functional programming languages like F#. But there is solution for this problem - project called Fable which allows us to compile F# code to JavaScript. During the talk I'll show how to create VS Code extensions using this project
