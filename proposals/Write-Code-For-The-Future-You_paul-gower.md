Description
-----------

How many jobs will you have before you retire? A typical worker in the United States switches jobs every 4-5 years; in the tech industry stays are even shorter. Due to this software developers are guaranteed both to work on someone elseâ€™s code and someone will work on our code.  To survive, it is critical you continue to add value by improving the quality of the code you write and/or maintain in your job as a software developer.  In this session, we will define what it means to improve the quality of the code and give you practical steps towards improving it every day.
