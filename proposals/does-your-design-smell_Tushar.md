Description
-----------
"A good designer is one who knows about the design principles but a great designer is one who understands the problems (or smells) with the design, their cause, and how they can be addressed by applying proven and sound design principles". This talk focuses on the design smells, its different types with the help of a comprehensive catalog, its impact on the software, and actionable suggestions to refactor them in real-world settings.

Extended abstract (for reviewers)
---------------------------------
I have delivered this talk many times at reputed international forums. In this talk, I present a traffic metaphor that shows many traffic-related problems in the first part of my talk that makes people laugh. In the second part, I map all the traffic problems to the design smells and describe them briefly.
