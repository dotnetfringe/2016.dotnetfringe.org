Description
-----------

Developing a distributed software solution is hard. Even if you boil it down to modular pieces and nicely define deployment boundaries, what matters at the end is that all of those modular pieces should work together in a cohesive way. It's a must to get it building and working locally to see it in action but it's a challenge if you have too many moving parts. Not to mention you need to control this many moving parts in production, too.

I have been working in a .NET project and it has many moving parts including MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, HTTP Services, worker processes, clients... I felt the pain very deeply. However, I was able to see the light at the end with Docker. Docker made it easy to glue all the pieces together in development, pre-production environments and production. Getting the application up and running is just possible by running a single bash script thanks to Docker's declarative nature.

But, how? How does it all work together? What are the tips and tricks to get it all functioning properly? Is Docker the magic silver bullet? What are the caveats? Join me in this session to walk you through the 1000 feet overview of this architecture and answer these questions based on my experience. By the end of this talk, you should have the right concepts in your mind to start thinking about bringing your solution to a high quality, stress-free level.
