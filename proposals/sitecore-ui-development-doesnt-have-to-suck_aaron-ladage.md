Description

Sitecore is an incredibly flexible CMS, but that flexibility comes with a few caveats — especially when it comes to how you implement your UI development into it. Without some careful planning, you can easily stretch your system to the point of breaking. In this session, we'll discuss how to create a first-rate content-management experience, as well as strategies for writing and optimizing your CSS and JavaScript in such a customizable environment.
