In this talk, the approach of using event-sourced architecture as a way of getting to an MVP faster and more responsibly is explored. Many approaches to new projects or start ups intend for version 1 of the solution to be thrown away. The sad truth is that most of the time these badly implemented first attempts live on as pressures from customers or promises made by sales force a very heavy burden.
What if there was a way to develop responsibly from the start and avoid the pitfalls of anti-patterns that give the illusion of getting the MVP done quickly? Building software fast and correctly is a matter of changing the way the work is done and should not cost any additional cycles.
If outsourcing or off-shoring a lot of the work seems like a pipedream for the first few months of a start up, it's time to take at the problem in detail. With a proper separation of high-risk and high-value areas from the low-risk, low-value, this approach becomes a better strategy than the typical start-up pattern. This involves methods of avoiding the integration by database anti-pattern and embraces pub-sub architecture from the beginning.
