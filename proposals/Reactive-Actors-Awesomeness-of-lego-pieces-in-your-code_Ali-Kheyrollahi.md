Description
-----------
Inspired by reactive programming paradigm and actor model, you can start building loosely coupled components especially in an emerging architecture where the direction and boundary of the domains is not yet established. BeeHive combines the goodness of horizontal scaling and high availability with ease of single-method actor programming.

Reactive actors is a form of building small independent Microservices where they can be loosely wired together based on the events they generate. Unlike command-based systems. events take away the knowledge of the callee from the caller, hence leading to decoupling actors, very much like Inversion of Control results in decoupling pieces of code.
