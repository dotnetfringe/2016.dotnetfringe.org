Actor Clustering with Docker Containers and Akka.Net in F#
========================

* Speaker   : Riccardo Terrell
* Available : Always
* Length    : 45 mins

Description
-----------

In this session, you will learn to build and deploy distributed systems combining the power of Akka.Net, the flexibility of F# Remoting, and the simplicity of Docker containers.  The combination of these technologies enhances the effects of F# “code-quotation”, which allows the deployment of arbitrary Actors into remote Actor-Systems. 
You will learn the basic concepts behind Microservices implemented using the Actor Clustering, and how to leverage Docker containers for easy deployment. 
Docker is the new shining star in the dev-ops world. It allows you to easily deploy images to any OS running Docker, while providing an isolated environment for the applications running inside the container image.  Akka.Net is a framework to build concurrent, resilient, distributed and scalable software systems. The cluster feature lets you distribute your Actors across multiple machines to achieve load balancing, fail-over and the ability to scale up and out.  F# is a strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming techniques. During this session we will build and deploy an Actor Cluster to distribute an image recognition system using multiple Machine Learning concepts.
