* Length    : 30 mins

Description
-----------

Most .NET mocking frameworks use complicated IL generation techniques to create code on the fly. With the new Compiler APIs in .NET 4.6, it's easy to create, compile, and run code using well-known managed languages like C# and VB. In this session, you'll see how Rocks (https://github.com/jasonbock/rocks) uses the Compiler API for code generation and execution, and how you can use the same APIs for other dynamic environments.
