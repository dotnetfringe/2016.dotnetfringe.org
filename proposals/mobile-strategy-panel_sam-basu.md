###Title: Mobile Strategy Panel!

###Description:It’s 2016 and we have been doing mobile for 10 years now. Yet, the whole mobile strategy dilemma still lingers – native/web/hybrid mobile apps? May be there isn’t a silver bullet & the answer truly depends. When does each make sense? Is hybrid or native better to go cross-platform? What’s the future with wearables & IoT?All this & more in one brutally honest panel discussion. Let’s tame the beast!###Speaker Bio:
