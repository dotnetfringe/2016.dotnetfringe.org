Description
-----------

There are many good developers in our industry, but few are truly great. Join a Stack Overflow Engineering Manager for a candid discussion of the journey to developer greatness. In this session we'll travel beyond code and commits into the realm of habits, core competencies, ego, ethics, and everything else that makes a developer great.
