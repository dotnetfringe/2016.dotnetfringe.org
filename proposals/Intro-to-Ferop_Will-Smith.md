Ferop is a .NET library that allows inline C/C++ to compile and run on Windows/Linux/OSX. It is written entirely in F# and works not only in F# projects, but also C# and VB. The use cases for using such a library include using C/C++ libraries that do not contain any .NET bindings; these libraries typically could be useful for game development purposes.
