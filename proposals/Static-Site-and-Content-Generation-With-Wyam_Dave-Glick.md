## Description

Static content generation is one of the easiest ways to scale a web application. Static sites 
can also be simpler to maintain, have fewer performance issues, are secure, and can be created 
quickly. They don't have to be boring either. New services make it possible to add 
all sorts of awesome dynamic capabilities and modern patterns and tools like continuous integration
make it easy to generate your site or content on your terms.

Join the author of [Wyam](http://wyam.io), a new .NET static generation tool, as 
we dive into static sites, what they are, and how to publish and host them. There's a lot more to
the story than Jekyll blogs and GitHub Pages. Wyam is designed from the ground-up to be flexible and 
customizable, and is based on Roslyn and other modern .NET technologies. I'll demonstrate how to use 
it to build different kinds of sites like blogs and API documentation. I'll also show how it was 
used to power-up [Up-For-Grabs.net](http://up-for-grabs.net/) by migrating from Jekyll and integrating 
custom code such as pulling data from the GitHub API.
