Description
-----------
From the mathematicians and scientists of the 20th centuries to today's ninja craftsmen/craftswomen, Software community hast lost something along the way. Instead of carefully observing scientific methods and maintaining objectivity, we have tangled ourselves in web of hype,  and celebrity culture - as if adopting today's YOLO motto. We have completely forgot how to reason scientifically about matters of technical dispute, instead, whoever is more opinionated or shouts louder wins - as if software is an abstract art where you can only form an opinion.

This talk is a critique of the status of quo. With a survey of the history of software, we will try to find our roots highlighting the wrong footsteps we have taken as an industry. It also shines a ray of light with the recent rise in adoption of scientific methods as a result of pick up in Machine Learning and Data Science. A sobering talk yet not without sprinkles of fun and sense of humour...
