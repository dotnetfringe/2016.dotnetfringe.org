Triage Some Open Source - Live!
========================

Description
-----------

Through various reasons, I've found myself maintaining a bunch of open source
projects. But what does this actually involve?

In this talk I'll queue up a bunch of interesting issues and pull requests and
work through them live on stage. This of course sounds really boring, so I'll
take time out to talk through my experiences of the ups and downs of being a
maintainer and what interacting with contributors from behind a keyboard
actually looks like.

Speaker Bio
