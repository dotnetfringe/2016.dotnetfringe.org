Rock helped build Microsoft Outlook 2007 and 2010, FogBugz 8, Kiln 1 and 2, and Articulate Storyline 2. Through it all, he worked to improve development processes: introducing unit testing to the Outlook team, improving devops at Fog Creek, and developing and open-sourcing SpecEasy for writing better unit tests. When he's not working from home, writing code or killing bugs, he likes to play Minecraft with his kids, ski, and ponder the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.
