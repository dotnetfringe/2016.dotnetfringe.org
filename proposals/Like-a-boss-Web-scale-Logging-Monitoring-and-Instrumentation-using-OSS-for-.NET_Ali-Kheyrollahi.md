"Netflix is actually a log generating application that just happens to stream movies"

This statement by the CTO of Amazon in praise of Netflix architecture highlights the importance of logging, monitoring and instrumentation (LMI) especially in Highly Available cloud solutions.

In this talk we will elaborate the importance of stringent LMI in successful in any successful application especially Microservices and discuss the merits of the approach by taking advantage of ETW events in conjunction with three OSS tools/libraries: PerfIt, ConveyorBelt and SuperBenchmarker. With a hands-on demo we will review the approach and at the end finish with the monitoring differences between development and production environments.

These approaches have been rolled out throughout ASOS, churning more than 100GB of logs across more than 20 different platform teams providing realtime information and alerting.
