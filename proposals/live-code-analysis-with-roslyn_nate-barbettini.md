========================

* Speaker   : Nate Barbettini

* Length    : 45 mins

Description
-----------

Static code analysis is a great tool for writing clean code, and Visual Studio 2015 added support for powerful live code analyzers via the Roslyn API. Now anyone can build analyzers like StyleCop and FxCop to improve code style or enforce conventions.
Itâ€™s pretty easy to get started!

In this talk, I'll cover: how the Roslyn API works, building a simple analyzer, and testing it against real code. I'll also share recommendations on great open-source analyzer packages to use in your own projects.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm the .NET Developer Evangelist at Stormpath in San Francisco, which means I'm "the dot net guy" in an office full of Java and Node engineers. :smile:

Prior to Stormpath, I was a full-stack developer working in C# and Angular, and ran a video production company producing short films and music videos. On the weekend you'll find me contributing to a number of open-source projects, editing short films, and training for a marathon.
