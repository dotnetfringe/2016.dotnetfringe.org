Description
-----------

True open-source is more than just posting the source code on GitHub; it is defined by the Community and its mentality.

During this talk I will focus on a different side of F# - the fantastic and productive software Community dedicated to providing cross-platform open source tooling to make the life of every F# developer better. 

I will present 4 tools created by Community - Paket (dependency managment), FAKE (build automation), Forge (project scaffolding and managment), and Ionide (editor tooling) - and how using them together creates modern, productive development environment.
