========================

* Speaker   : Tugberk Ugurlu

Description
-----------

ASP.NET had a good reputation on being tied to IIS and Windows for long time now and it's about to officially change. We have seen the glimpse of it with project Katana but now it's going to be inevitable to ignore along with ASP.NET Core 1 and .NET Core. As usual, this will raise new questions for you if you have never stepped outside of Windows since new possibilities are now available and we want to understand if there are anything that we are missing in other operating system platforms.

Join me in this session to see what I like about Linux ecosystem which I can take advantage of in my ASP.NET 5 and also see what are the challenges are. You will get to see some interesting demos with NGINX, HAProxy, Docker and potentially others.

At the end, I hope it will be less scary to imagine yourself outside of Windows land and you should also understand how ASP.NET 5 applications can play well with mature software applications that have been in Linux land for long time.
