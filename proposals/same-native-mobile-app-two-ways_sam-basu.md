###Title: Same Native Mobile App – Two ways, with C# & JavaScript!

###Description:You want to build your next cross-platform mobile app, but want to go native. Choice is a great thing, and you have two wonderful technologies at your disposal – Xamarin and NativeScript!With Xamarin, you get to use the familiarity of C# and Visual Studio to build native mobile apps that run everywhere. Access to native APIs and polished UI controls add to your arsenal towards the next big cross-platform app.With NativeScript, you get to build a truly native cross-platform mobile app with either JavaScript or TypeScript. With easy XML UI markup, CSS styling, choice of IDEs and a rich plugins/API stack, you can just as easily build your next cross-platform app that is native.No matter what be your tech stack – C# or JavaScript, tooling has come of age to build true native cross-platform apps. Let’s build the same app both ways and take away lessons learnt.###Speaker Bio:
