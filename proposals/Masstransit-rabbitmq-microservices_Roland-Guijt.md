========================

* Speaker   : Roland Guijt
* Available : Always
* Length    : 60 mins

Description
-----------

MassTransit is an open source distributed application framework and servicebus for .Net. RabbitMq, also open source, is the underlying middleware that handles low level messages initiated by MassTransit.
The both are ideal to setup a Microservice archtictecture for free! In the new 3.0 of MassTransit the API is very smooth and async is supported out of the box. 
In this session I'll quickly show you the basics arround messaging and microservices and how to get up and running quickly and I'll show you an example microservice archtitecture.
You'll also learn why sagas (persistant workflows) are a very powerful feature in MassTransit.
After attending you'll have a new perspective on application architecture and the knowledge necessary to start with MassTransit, RabbitMQ in a microservice architecture.
