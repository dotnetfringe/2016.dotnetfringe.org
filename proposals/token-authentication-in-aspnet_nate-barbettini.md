========================

* Speaker   : Nate Barbettini
* Available : Anytime 
* Length    : 45-60 mins

Description
-----------

Having trouble scaling because of server-based sessions? Token authentication removes the burden of storing session state on the server. Want to make the switch to token authentication, but donâ€™t know how? And what the heck is OAuth, anyway?

In this talk, I'll cover topics such as:

* What is OAuth?
* OAuth2 tokens and grant types
* How to use cookies the right way
* Why JWTs make great OAuth2.0 tokens
* Protecting against XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks
* Protecting against CSRF (cross-site request forgery) attacks

Speaker Bio

I'm the .NET Developer Evangelist at Stormpath in San Francisco, which means I'm "the dot net guy" in an office full of Java and Node engineers. :smile:

Prior to Stormpath, I was a full-stack developer working in C# and Angular, and ran a video production company producing short films and music videos. On the weekend you'll find me contributing to a number of open-source projects, editing short films, and training for a marathon.
