==============================================

* Speaker   : *Chris Stead*
* Available : *July 10-12* 
* Length    : *~30 minutes*

Description
-----------

We will walk through creating a simple Visual Studio Code extension and integrating testing throughout the entire
process. Using Golden Master tests, we will add guarantees around non-executable files so checks are performed at test time
as well as at commit time. Our exploration will continue by looking into mocks and fakes using the Mockery library as well
as the factory pattern to break the vscode module dependency, giving us a way to fully test our code and ensure behavior throughout
our extension.
